[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
One day, I looked at my forum and saw that 9,870 out of 14,776 were unactivated, most of them over 1 year old.  This irritated me, so I wrote this mod to automatically remove members who haven't activated their account after a specified number of days.  There is also an option to email users that their membership has been deleted due to lack of activation of the membership.

Please note that this mod does not set the number of days setting initially.  You must do this in order for this mod to function.  I recommend 30 days, however, you can set it to whatever you want.

In [b]Admin[/b] => [b]Members[/b] => [b]Registration[/b] => [b]Settings[/b], there are 2 new settings:
o [b]Days before unactivated accounts are deleted[/b]
o [b]Notify users whose accounts are being deleted?[/b]

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.14 and SMF 2.1 Beta 3, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.
