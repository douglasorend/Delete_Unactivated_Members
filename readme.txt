[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
One day, I looked at my forum and saw that 9,870 out of 14,776 were unactivated, most of them over 1 year old.  This irritated me, so I wrote this mod to automatically remove members who haven't activated their account after a specified number of days.

Please note that this mod does not set the number of days setting.  You must do this in order for this mod to function.  I recommend 30 days, however, you can set it to whatever you want.

In [b]Admin[/b] => [b]Members[/b] => [b]Registration[/b] => [b]Settings[/b], there is a new setting:
o [b]Days before unactivated accounts are deleted[/b]

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.14, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.
